# concept-definitions-scraper
A Python script that extracts finalized concept definitions from a Confluence HTML space export and converts them into a clean, structured CSV.  The script filters pages by Page Status (Confluence Page Finalized), strips HTML from descriptions, extracts related resource links, and logs any invalid or internal links for review.
